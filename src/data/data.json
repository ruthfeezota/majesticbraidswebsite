  "About": {
    "paragraph": "Liz here, I started braiding hair as a side hustle while studying at CCRl. Creative, proficient, and passionate, I quickly mastered the craft and even began teaching others about hair care and styling.  For the past 10 years, I've been a successful braider in the greater Providence area.  Growing up here, I initially pursued a career in healthcare, but eventually decided to combine my love for hair with my healthcare background to create Majestic Braids.  I've always loved working with hair, and it's incredibly rewarding to know that my passion helps people feel confident.",
    "Why": [
      "Experienced: 10 years braiding in Providence means fast, efficient service and expertise with all hair types.",
      "Passionate: I love braiding, so you get top-quality care and attention to detail."
    ],
    "Why2": [
      "Local: I know Providence and understand our community's hair needs.",
      "Expert: My teaching background means I can help you maintain healthy hair and braids."
